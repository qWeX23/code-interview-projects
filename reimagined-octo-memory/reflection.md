- make new service called api that implements handler instead of the service ( i think this will still be hard to test this way )
- add tests
- add ci
- add kubernetes
- add pipeline for deploys
- add tests
- add swagger docs
- add more validation
- actually validate the logic 
- format and comment code if necessary
- refactor some items 


I enjoyed this assignment, it was challenging but fulfilling. I would love to see it implemented in the "real world". Spent about 3.5 hr.  could go longer but i think its in a good state as is.
