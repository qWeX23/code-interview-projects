# code-interview-projects

These are some of the take-home projects I've done for interviews. I've included the prompt and my solution for each project.
They are in no particular order and are from various companies. I want to keep them here for future reference and to show my work to others.
I do not wish to have them be used for cheating or plagiarism. I just want to have an archive of my work, and provide examples for others in the job market on what they could expect! (also i have had them in separate repos and it was getting cluttered so i wanted to consolidate them into one repo)
Hope you find them helpful!
